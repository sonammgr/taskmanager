## Installation

Follow these steps to get a development environment up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed (e.g., Python 3.11)
* PostgreSQL installed and running
* Git installed

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sonammgr/taskmanager.git](https://github.com/sonammgr/taskmanager.git)
    cd taskmanager
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Database Settings:**
    * Open your Django project's `settings.py` file.
    * Locate the `DATABASES` setting and modify it for PostgreSQL. You'll need to create a database and user in PostgreSQL first.
        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
                'NAME': 'your_db_name',     # e.g., 'taskmanager_db'
                'USER': 'your_db_user',     # e.g., 'taskmanager_user'
                'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
                'HOST': 'localhost',        # Or your PostgreSQL server IP/hostname
                'PORT': '',                 # Default PostgreSQL port is 5432
            }
        }
        ```

5.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser (for admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to set up a username, email, and password.

## Usage
